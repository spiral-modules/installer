Spiral Framework is a High-Performance PHP/Go Full-Stack framework and group of over sixty PSR-compatible components.
The Framework execution model based on a hybrid runtime where some services (GRPC, Queue, WebSockets, etc.) handled by
Application Server [RoadRunner](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner) and the PHP code of your application
stays in memory permanently (anti-memory leak tools included).

<br />

## Server Requirements

Make sure that your server is configured with following PHP version and extensions:

* PHP 8.1+, 64bit
* [mb-string](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.mbstring.php) extension
* PDO Extension with desired database drivers

## Installation

```bash
composer create-project spiral/installer my-app
```

> **Note**:
> Application server will be downloaded automatically (`php-curl` and `php-zip` required).

<br />

After the project has been created and installed, start RoadRunner server using the following command:

```bash
cd my-app

./rr serve
```

<br />

Once you have started RoadRunner server, your application will be accessible in your web browser
at  `http://localhost:8080`.
